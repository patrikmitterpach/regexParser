(i.i) Most of mankind, Paulinus, complains about natures meanness, 
because our allotted span of life is so short, and because this stretch 
of time that is given to us runs its course so quickly, so rapidly â€” so 
much so that, with very few exceptions, life leaves the rest of us in 
the lurch just when we re getting ready to live. And its not just the 
masses and the unthinking crowd that complain at what they per- 
ceive as this universal evil; the same feeling draws complaints even 
from men of distinction. Hence that famous dictum of the greatest 
of physicians: "Life is short, art long." 1 (2) Hence also Aristotle's 
grievance, 2 most unbecoming a philosopher, when he called nature 
to account for bestowing so much time on animals that they can live 
for five or ten human life spans, while so much shorter a limit is set 
for humans, even though they are born to do so many great things. 

(3) It's not that we have a short time to live, but that we waste 
much of it. Life is long enough, and it's been given to us in generous 
measure for accomplishing the greatest things, if the whole of it is 
well invested. But when life is squandered through soft and careless 
living, and when it's spent on no worthwhile pursuit, death finally 
presses and we realize that the life which we didn't notice passing 
has passed away. (4) So it is: the life we are given isn't short but we 
make it so; we're not ill provided but we are wasteful of life. Just as 
impressive and princely wealth is squandered in an instant when it 
passes into the hands of a poor manager, but wealth however modest 
grows through careful deployment if it is entrusted to a responsible 
guardian, just so our lifetime offers ample scope to the person who 
maps it out well.
